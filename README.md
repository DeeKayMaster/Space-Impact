# SpaceImpact
This is a final project from object-oriented programming course at my Univeristy.<br/>
It's create in Python with PyGame library.<br/>
I wanted to recreated a well-known game - Space Imact from legendary mobile phone NOKIA 3310.<br/>
If you want to play the game you have to run game.py file.
